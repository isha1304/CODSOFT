# CODSOFT
It contains all the tasks that I have implemented during my CODSOFT Internship.

TASK 1 - Number Game
The aim is to create a Java Program in which a user is given K chances to estimate a randomly generated number between 1 to 100. The user's guess is compared with the generated number and the program will display whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.

TASK 2 - Student grade calculator
The Java code represents a simple student grading system that takes user input to determine the grades based on the average percentage achieved of a specified number of subjects. It prompts the user to enter the number of subjects and then collects their respective marks through a loop.It shows the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.

TASK 3 - ATM Interface
The task is to create an ATM interface with options for withdrawing, depositing, and checking balance. User input is validated within acceptable limits, such as having sufficient funds for withdrawals.

TASK 4 -  Quiz App
This document describes a quiz application created using Java and Swing. The application allows users to take quizzes on multiple categories with time limits and scoring. It was designed to be run locally without internet.

TASK 5 - Student Course Registration System
The system will store course information (code, title, description, capacity, schedule) and student information (ID, name, registered courses). It will display available courses with details and available slots. Students can register for available courses and drop registered courses.
